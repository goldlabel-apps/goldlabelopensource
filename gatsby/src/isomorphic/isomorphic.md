## Deploy the same JavaScript code everywhere

> In the world of JavaScript the fact code can be shared across devices with a JavaScript runtime could be called "**Isomorphic**"

### Here's why it's useful

Isomorphic JavaScript, aka Universal JavaScript, refers to the ability to write code that can run both on the client-side (in a web browser) and on the server-side (on a server)

This means you can write JavaScript code that can be executed in different environments, such as in a web browser, on a server using Node.js, or even in other environments like PWAs using frameworks like React

- **Code Reusability**: With isomorphic JavaScript, you can write code once and use it in multiple places without having to rewrite it for each environment. This saves time and effort and reduces code duplication

- SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Rendering content on the server-side allows search engines to crawl and index it more easily, which can improve the search engine rankings of your web application

- Performance: Rendering content on the server-side can also improve the initial loading time of your web application, as some content can be sent to the client already rendered, reducing the amount of work that the client-side JavaScript needs to do

- User Experience: Isomorphic JavaScript can provide a more seamless user experience by rendering some content on the server-side, which can be faster than waiting for all content to be loaded and rendered on the client-side
