## What is the primary factor motivating your departure from your most recent/current position, and what draws you to the prospect of working for Borderless?

In my 20 years of JavaScript experience, I've gained deep insights. As a contractor, I valued flexibility, but now seek impactful team roles. My primary motivation here is to share JavaScript knowledge in a collaborative setting, contributing to team growth. Transitioning from contractor to team member aligns with my career goals. I'm excited to collaborate, tackle challenges, and drive innovation with like-minded professionals.

## Can you discuss a complex technical challenge you faced in a previous role and how you overcame it?

A recurring complex challenge involves refactoring monolithic applications into modern, future-proof architectures. Often, there's understandable resistance to starting over, making it crucial to enact meaningful change with minimal disruption. This process may entail refactoring Angular code to React, but it consistently demands close cooperation within a well-led team.

## Have you mentored junior developers before? Describe your leadership style and its impact on team success.

I love mentoring junior team members in JavaScript development, drawing from my 20 years of experience to guide them through everyday challenges efficiently. By leveraging my expertise, I aim to minimize time lost to blocked issues and foster a supportive learning environment. Additionally, I actively participate in code reviews, both giving and receiving feedback, as I believe in continuous improvement and collaboration within the team.

## What are your insights on the future of software engineering, and how do you plan to adapt?

Presently, I find the prevalence of WordPress sites, constituting at least 50% of all websites, particularly intriguing. As these sites, built on outdated and sluggish architectures, will require replacement in the coming years, I am keen to contribute to the transformation of this landscape. My plan is to actively participate in shaping the future platforms that will replace these websites, thereby aligning myself with the evolving trends in software engineering.
