Profile
I’m a Full Stack JavaScript Developer with 20 years experience developing web apps. I specialise in using React and Node, to create UIs with modern Design Systems. I learned to bridge the gap between design and technical. I’m as comfortable talking to stakeholders about high level functionality as I am discussing technical coding problems with developers. I have an appreciation of commercial pressure and the ability to follow and meet briefs on time.
