Modular additions to a Gatsby static site generating frontend developed by Listingslab. 

To use them you need to install them carefully into your project and update them periodically. This is the stuff which is not Open Source. 

If you a legit developer, you are welcome to acccess. The only reason it isn't yet Open Source is because it's not cleaned up, bullet proof and easily installable
