#### What's the difference between Chat GPT & Open AI? 

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab that has developed various AI models, including ChatGPT. OpenAI's primary focus is on advancing artificial intelligence in different domains, including language understanding, robotics, and more.

ChatGPT, on the other hand, is a specific AI language model developed by OpenAI. It's based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture and is designed specifically for generating human-like text based on the input it receives. ChatGPT's primary function is to engage in conversation, answer questions, generate text, and perform various language-related tasks based on the training it has received.
