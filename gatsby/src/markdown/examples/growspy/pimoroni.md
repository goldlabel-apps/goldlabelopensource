## [Growspy](https://growspy.app) uses a Pimoroni Enviro Grow [which you can buy here](https://shop.pimoroni.com/packages/enviro-grow?variant=40055904305235)

#### Who are Pimoroni?
Pimoroni are the genius behind the Enviro Grow. They design, manufacture, and sell electronics and accessories for Raspberry Pi and more. 

Known for creating fun, innovative, and user-friendly packages aimed at makers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts in the field of electronics and computing

#### What is Enviro Grow?

Pimoroni Enviro Grow comes with three capacitive moisture sensors to monitor up to three pots or trays of seeds separately. Because there are no exposed electrodes, capacitive sensors are a lot less vulnerable to corrosion over time than old school resistive sensors. There's also a buzzer so it can signal your attention. The onboard sensors can measure temperature, humidity, pressure and light so you can finetune the growing conditions for your plants

On the back of Enviro Grow there are another three connectors that will let you turn low-current 5v devices like pumps, motors, valves, solenoids or lights on and off. There's also a Qw/ST connector for if you want to grow your smart watering system and add more I2C sensors.

#### Enviro x Pico W Aboard

Our new Enviro (Pico W Aboard) range is designed with environmental monitoring / logging in mind. We wanted to make a range of Pico/RP2040-powered, all-in-one sensor boards that are compact, easy to install in places and straightforward to program. The wireless capability of Raspberry Pi Pico W lets Enviro integrate with other systems - so you could post your data into databases, home automation systems, or online citizen science efforts - the Internet's your lobster!

#### Lots of sensors

Because the least fun thing about adding lots of sensors to your environment is figuring out how supply power to everything without tons of trailing wires, they are all designed to work well off battery power.  Each Enviro board has an onboard RTC (Real Time Clock), so that they can periodically wake up from deep sleep, take a reading (and, optionally, connect to wifi) and then go back to sleep - giving you months of untethered battery life

#### Slick provisioning software

Enviro ships with some super slick provisioning software that makes it really easy to set it up and connect to things, even if it's your first foray into environmental logging/IoT
