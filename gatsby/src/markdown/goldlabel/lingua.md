Lingua is our multi language translation package. Localisation is not something you want to simply bolt onto a website at the end. Users will do that themselves if they cared enough about reading anything you have written. Which they don't. Lingua makes the user feel the app is aimed for them. It's a trust thing

### Why bother?
Because localisation is very difficult and not something you want to simply bolt 
on to an app as an afterthought. Lingua makes the user feel the app is aimed for them. It's a trust thing
