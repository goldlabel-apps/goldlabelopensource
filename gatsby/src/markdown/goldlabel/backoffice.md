Goldlabel Apps can be hosted anywhere but they all need to talk to the same system. That would be our back office system. It lives on Google Cloud as a firebase project

At the heart of any system is the Database. Firebase. It's better than good. Forget everything you know about MySQL, NoSQL, Mongo DB. You just don't need it. Place your trust in Google. Don't reinvent the space ship
