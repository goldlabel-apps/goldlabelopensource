Little Tommy one leg wanted to work at listingslab all his life. Didn't pass the genetic profiling cos of his having only one leg so he was sent to shitlab instead but secretly studied listings after dark with a torch under the blankets

One day someone from the shit lab had to go and see listings lab about some shit, and little Tommy one leg stowed away

while the shit was going down at listings lab Tommy snuck out and unscrewed an air vent to gain access to listings lab... he lived in the ceilings for months observing the listers, finding out how things worked there... eventually he was able to find a discarded lab coat...

He hit the floor all humble and efficient and started working.... being absent minded coders the listers didn't really notice... they just thought hr had sent some kid down... the listers never really pay much attention to hr... think they're a bunch of numptys for the most part...

That's where we're at.... cos that's what's in the picture. He’s barely had any adventures yet, I’m waiting for the next image prompt

Tommy had made himself quite a comfortable home in the cavernous ceilings of the listings lab... he continued to keep a low profile on the lab floor quietly soaking up all the knowledge he could during work hours, the absent minded coders soon got used to him being around and they're not the type to ask too many questions.....

In the evenings though he had free run of the lab....food wasn't a problem he raided the canteen often for himself and the small white cat who also lived in the ceiling... Tommy named him Code, the best nights were when he found tuna... code's favourite

Code was the only person, albeit a non human one who knew Tommy's full story.....they were best friends

There was someone else who knew Tommy was living above the lab though... something.....

The Source, the glowing blue white orb, holder of all listings, the sentient ai at the centre of listings lab

Source could have alerted the coders or hr to tommy's presence but he knew the coders liked having Tommy around and Source didn't really think that much of hr either.... Source was intrigued by Tommy and wanted to see what he would do next, he was also very glad Code had someone to feed him tuna, for as intelligent and powerful as Source was, they had no arms or legs and couldn't get the tuna himself

One night while Tommy was learning listings and Code was catching digital mice Source was able to break through and communicate with Tommy ... Source had been watching Tommy for some time now and an idea was forming in their glowing blue brainself....
