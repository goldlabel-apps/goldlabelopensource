Fullstack is one of those industry terms rapidly loosing meaning from overuse. In the olden days there was a very clear difference between someone who made the frontend of an app and a person who made the backend. People who could do both were vanishingly rare because it was simply 2 different skills which existed only in 2 differennt personality types. 

With improvements in both how people think about technology and the tools which have evolved alongside that a new breed of developer has emerged called Fullstack. It simply means someone who can do both, nothing more
