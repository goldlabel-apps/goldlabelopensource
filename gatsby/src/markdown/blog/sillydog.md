Usually when the wizardz start waking up I’m on the bed, so if they’re not too grumpy I might try lickin em. Lickin is my faaaavourite thing. It’s important to follow the wizardz around closely in the morning because sometimes the wizard with the fluffy head dishes out free bisskits. I like bisskits cos they’re crunchy on my mouth. They are also my faaaavourite thing. The wizardz have a loudbox they call Van. It’s mad. You get in it and everything goes mental for ages, you get a windyface and too too too many smells and then it stops, you could be anywhere. Most of the time I don’t really know where I am. Some days we go to the beach.... Oh i luuuuvvvv the beach, it’s so sandysalty and wetsmelly and birdychasy and otherdoggy... but when we get home I sometimes have a bath which is not my faaaavourite thing. I am digging a hole behind the shed underneaf the ropeytreevinefing, today i got stuck in the ropeytreevine and had to wait for a wizard to come get me out.... Stuff like that happens a lot when you’re a Sillydog. When it’s darktime and the wizardz have their humanfood I stare at them until they give me some.... If i’m really lucky I get a fing!!!! Fings are great, I don’t normally have ‘em, usually people just take fingz away from me... when i get a fing I like to take it away and look at it... then I like to show it to the wizardz... then i eat it, just in case it’s food. My bed is on the floor next to the wizards but as soon as i hear the big one snoring i jump up on the bed... In the sleepworld otherplace I chase rabbits and bark a little bit, but that’s a whole other story...Fluffy wizard says i snore as loud as big wizard but I don’t believe her... I get in the way a bit and wizards accidentally boot me in the gish. Dun’t matter, it’s pretty good being Sillydog, the only thing that ever troubles me is... What if I never find out who’s a good doggy?
