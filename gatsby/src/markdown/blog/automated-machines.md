It's AM. Automated Machines

Imagine you're Marvin. Brain the size of a planet but you're not depressed. You're an AM. You have one job, but it could be anything. 

The monkeys out there are busy picking peanuts out of poo, eating the peanuts and flinging the poo at each other. Their iPhones are a portal to affecting their surroundings, emotions, relationships, biological functions and almost everything you can think of. 

Your one job is to cater to those needs because you belong to the iPhone people. Who are also monkeys, picking peanuts out of poo.

Would you care about a bit of monkey on monkey violence? Oppression or totalalitaianism? Well... that's the question isn't it
