### Message computers use to check another computer is ready

Okay, imagine you're playing catch with your friend in a big field. You throw a ball to your friend, and when they catch it, they throw it back to you, right? 

Well, in computer world, when one computer wants to check if another computer is there and ready to play, it sends a little message, like saying "Hey, are you there?" 

That little message is called a ping. 

It's like asking, "Hey, are you ready to catch the ball?" If the other computer is there, it catches the ping and throws back a reply, just like catching the ball and throwing it back to you. 

If it doesn't reply, it's like your friend not catching the ball or being busy with something else. 

So, in simple words, a ping is just a little message computers use to check if another computer is ready to communicate or play.
