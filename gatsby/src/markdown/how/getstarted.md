#### Get started

Where will you clone the repository to? Call this `<working-repo>`. Decide on a machine readable name `<your-project>`. Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
cd <working-dir>
git clone https://github.com/listingslab-software/open-source <your-project>
cd <your-project>
cd gatsby
npm install
cd ../
npm run
```
