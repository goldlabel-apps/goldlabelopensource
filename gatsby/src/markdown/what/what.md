### Goldlabel is performance, speed & SEO

> Given that 50% of the internet is made up of WordPress websites, how does Goldlabel stack up against it?

#### Goldlabel
Static site generators, like Goldlabel, produce pre-built pages that load quickly since there is no need for server-side processing during user requests. This can lead to a better user experience and improved SEO rankings, as Google tends to favor faster-loading websites  

#### WordPress
WordPress sites often rely on server-side processing and database queries to generate pages dynamically, which can result in slower loading times compared to statically generated sites.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

#### Goldlabel 

Static sites are inherently more SEO-friendly. With Goldlabel, you have control over metadata, heading structures, and other SEO elements for each page, optimizing them for search engines. Also, search engines tend to favor sites with faster loading times.

#### WordPress 
While WordPress offers SEO plugins and tools, the dynamic nature of the platform may result in performance issues and can require additional optimization efforts.

## Scalability and Security

#### Goldlabel
Static sites are often more scalable and secure because there is no need for server-side processing. Goldlabel sites can be easily deployed and distributed globally, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities associated with dynamic server environments.

#### WordPress

As a dynamic platform, WordPress sites may require more attention to security measures, regular updates, and potentially more resources to handle increased traffic.

## Content Management

#### Goldlabel

While Goldlabel is a static site generator, it can be combined with headless CMS (Content Management System) solutions, providing a flexible and efficient way to manage content.

#### WordPress

WordPress is a full-fledged CMS, and its dynamic nature makes it easy to update and manage content. However, the flexibility comes with a trade-off in terms of performance.

## Development Flexibility

#### Goldlabel 

Goldlabel allows for a modern and flexible development approach using React, GraphQL, and other modern web technologies. Developers have more control over the frontend and can optimize the site structure for SEO.

#### WordPress

WordPress, while highly customizable through themes and plugins, may require more effort to achieve certain design and functionality goals, and developers may need to navigate a more extensive codebase.

When comparing static site generation with Goldlabel to WordPress for a company website aiming to rank well in Google, several business-related factors come into play
