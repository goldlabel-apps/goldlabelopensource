No App Store approval process required

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) offer several advantages when it comes to app stores and the overall app distribution ecosystem. Here are some reasons why PWAs are considered beneficial in this context:

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** PWAs are built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), which makes them platform-agnostic. This means they can work on various devices and operating systems without the need to develop separate versions for each platform, reducing development time and costs.

**No App Store Approval Process:** Unlike traditional native apps, PWAs don't need to go through the rigorous approval process of app stores. This speeds up the deployment and updates, allowing developers to push new features and bug fixes directly to users without delays caused by review processes.

**Discoverability:** While app stores can be crowded and competitive, PWAs can be discovered through search engines just like any other website. This can lead to better discoverability and easier user acquisition without solely relying on app store rankings.

**Direct Distribution:** PWAs can be distributed directly from a website or server, eliminating the need for intermediaries like app stores. This gives developers more control over the distribution of their apps and reduces dependency on third-party platforms.

**Reduced Friction:** Users don't need to go through the process of downloading and installing PWAs from an app store. They can simply access them through a URL, which reduces the friction between discovering an app and using it. This can lead to higher user engagement and retention rates.

**Automatic Updates:** PWAs are designed to update in the background, ensuring that users always have access to the latest version without requiring them to manually update from an app store.

**Storage Efficiency:** PWAs are often smaller in size compared to native apps, as they don't need to package as much code and resources. This can save users' device storage space.

**Link Sharing:** Sharing a PWA is as simple as sharing a URL. This ease of sharing can lead to more organic user growth, as users can easily pass along links to their friends and colleagues.

**Offline Functionality:** PWAs can work offline or in low-network conditions, using technologies like service workers to cache resources. This can enhance the user experience in situations where network connectivity is unreliable.

**Cost Savings:** Developing and maintaining a single codebase for a PWA that works across multiple platforms can be more cost-effective than building separate native apps for each platform.
