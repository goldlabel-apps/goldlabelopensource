When developers use the term Vanilla JS, they are referring to plain, standard JavaScript code, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. In other words, Vanilla JS represents the core JavaScript language and its native APIs, as defined by the ECMAScript specification.

The word "vanilla" is used metaphorically here, where "vanilla" typically means something plain or basic, without any additional flavors or enhancements. Similarly, Vanilla JS is the pure and unmodified form of JavaScript, free from the influence of third-party libraries or frameworks.

Using Vanilla JS means writing code with the native JavaScript language and utilizing the built-in methods and functionalities provided by browsers. This approach is often considered lightweight, more straightforward, and allows developers to have full control over their code.

On the other hand, developers may choose to use various libraries and frameworks to simplify and expedite their development process, as these external tools can provide pre-built functionalities, abstractions, and utilities that solve common challenges. However, these libraries come with additional file sizes, dependencies, and sometimes learning curves.

The decision to use Vanilla JS or a library/framework depends on the specific project requirements, team preferences, and development goals. Sometimes, a project might be simple enough to be efficiently handled with just Vanilla JS, while other projects might benefit from the additional features and organization offered by a library or framework.
