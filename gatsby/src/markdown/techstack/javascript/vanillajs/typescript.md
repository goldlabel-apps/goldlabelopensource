It took us a while to embrace TypeScript in our work. Having grown up with earlier versions of JavaScript which did not have Types, we had to code around those problems

To allow JavaScript apps to be worked on by other, proper, good-boy-haircut developers (the ones who can who actually made proper software) they would have to be given Types or they wouldn't be able to code JS. Which was true. TypeScript does add yet another annoying learning curve for a JavaScript Developer. 

> "We don't need your stinkin' Typing; Just code better"  
was our attitude

Turns out we were wrong. Using TypeScript strengthens a project in many ways, but the bottom line is that it makes them more robust because it simply forces developers to code properly, not cut corners and generally produce real, modern software.

So now all our code is TypeScript. All React uses the `.tsx` extention. Our work in Node is also Typed and this allows is to streamline any backend integration
