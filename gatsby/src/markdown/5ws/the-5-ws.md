The rule you're referring to in journalism is commonly known as the "5 Ws (and sometimes H)" or the "Five Ws and One H." This guideline suggests that a news article should answer the following questions to provide a complete story:

1. **Who?** - Identifies the people involved in the story, including names, positions, and their roles.
2. **What?** - Describes the event or the situation, explaining what happened.
3. **When?** - Provides the timing of the event, including dates, times, and the duration.
4. **Where?** - Specifies the location where the event took place, giving as much detail as necessary to understand the context.
5. **Why?** - Explains the reasons behind the event, the causes, and possibly the motives.
6. **How?** (sometimes included) - Describes the process or method through which the event happened, explaining how it unfolded.

This guideline helps journalists create comprehensive reports that give readers a full understanding of the news story. It ensures that articles are informative, answering the most critical questions that readers are likely to have. This approach also helps in maintaining a structured narrative, making the information accessible and digestible.
