The "Allow cookies" pop-up you see on many websites is a result of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In simple terms, GDPR is a set of rules designed to protect the privacy of individuals when their personal data is collected and used by websites.

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device that websites use to remember information about you, such as your preferences or login details. Some cookies can also be used to track your online behavior for advertising purposes.

GDPR requires websites to be transparent about the use of cookies and to obtain your consent before storing them on your device. The "Allow cookies" pop-up is a way for websites to ask for your permission to use these cookies. It gives you the choice to accept or reject the use of cookies based on your preferences.

While it might seem annoying, the idea is to give you more control over your personal information and online privacy. It ensures that you are aware of and agree to the use of cookies by the websites you visit. So, the next time you see that pop-up, it's a reminder that the website wants your permission to use cookies in line with GDPR regulations.
