The Um El Faroud wreck lies parallel to the West Reef, her stern closest to the valley and starboard side towards the reef. The wreck is located approximately 150 m southwest from the entry/exit point in Wied iz-Zurrieq and is usually dived from the shore. Halfway to the wreck is a diving helmet statue as a landmark.

The overall length of Um El Faroud is 110 m with a beam of about 16m. The wreck sits upright on a sandy bottom at the depths of 15 m (funnel) to 36 m (propeller). The tanker was prepared for diving before scuttling by removing all doors and windows and cutting entry and exit holes for divers. Um El Faroud offers lots of penetration possibilities for experienced wreck divers.

### History

MV Um El Faroud was built at Smith's Dock Co. Ltd. in Middlesbrough, England and launched on 31st May 1969. The steel tanker was 109.5 m long with beam of 15.5 m and height from keel to funnel top about 22 m. Her original name was MV Seafalcon for the first four years while she was working in Norway. In 1973 the oil tanker was renamed as MV Um El Faroud in Libya, first owned by National Oil Corporation and then by General National Maritime Transport Company. She operated between Italy and Libya carrying refined fuel until 1995.

Um El Faroud was at dry docks in Grand Harbour of Malta for maintenance works, when on 3rd February 1995 after 10 pm in the evening an enormous gas explosion occurred. Nine shipyard workers lost their lives in the explosion; seven were killed instantly, and two died later at St Luke's Hospital. In addition, several other workers were injured but survived. This is one of the worst disasters in the peacetime history of Malta.
