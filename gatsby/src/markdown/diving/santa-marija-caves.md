Santa Marija Caves is a popular diving spot in Comino, accessible only by boat. There are about ten caves divers can explore. There’s something different about every cave, so you’re in for a unique experience. On the vertical walls, you can see many light reflections. There’s a lot of marine life here, like octopuses, crabs, lobsters, red mullets, and moray eels. These caves also make a great photo and video spots. The caves are shallow, so divers of all levels can dive here.
