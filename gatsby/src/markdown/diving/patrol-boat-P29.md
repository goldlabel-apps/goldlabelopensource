Some people consider that the P29 steals the limelight from the nearby Rozi wreck because it has several interesting features, including an intact machine gun. The East German minesweeper became a Maltese Patrol Boat in 1997, and sunk just ten years later

She P29 sits on a sandy bottom at 36 metres in a flat position off the limits of Cirkewwa in the north of Malta
