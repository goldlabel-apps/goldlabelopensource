This natural rock formation resembling an upright tube and carved out over thousands of years by wind and wave power, offers a sheltered entry for this dive through a huge archway starting at 6 m stretching right down to the bottom at 15m

A large cave at the bottom of the hole, exactly opposite the archway, is also worth exploring, offering spectacular scenery from the back

Out of the Blue Hole, we follow the wall to the right going straight towards the area where the Azure Window stood, an impressive archway which attracted thousands of tourists above water and quite as striking underwater. Diving around the outer leg, the steep slope is covered with massive boulders home to several groupers, adding an extra bonus to this incredibly scenic dive
