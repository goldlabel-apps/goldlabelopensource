### Growspy

> Every 5 minutes. That's how often to wake the [Enviro Grow](/techstack/pimoroni) up to take readings and post them to the API? The device consumes no power when it's asleep. How often we wake it up to take readings is a big factor in deciding how often to do it. When it wakes up, it takes the readings & posts the data to the Listingslab API in the cloud. Then it goes back to sleep and consumes no power
