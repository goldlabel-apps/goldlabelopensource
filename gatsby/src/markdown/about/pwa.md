### Improve user engagement, increase conversions, and build a more competitive presence

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that utilize modern web technologies to provide a native app-like experience to users. They are built using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but with added features and capabilities that enable them to function similarly to native mobile apps.

Here are some key characteristics of Progressive Web Apps:

1. **Reliability**: PWAs can work offline or with a poor internet connection, thanks to service workers that cache important resources.

2. **Performance**: They load quickly and respond smoothly to user interactions, providing a seamless user experience.

3. **Engagement**: PWAs can be installed on a user's device, appearing on the home screen without needing to go through an app store. This increases user engagement and retention.

4. **Discoverability**: PWAs are linkable and indexable, making them discoverable through search engines.

5. **Responsive**: PWAs are responsive and adapt to various screen sizes and device orientations.

6. **Security**: PWAs are served over HTTPS, ensuring data security and integrity.

The technology behind PWAs has matured significantly in recent years. Major web browsers now support key PWA features, such as service workers and web app manifests, making it easier for developers to create PWAs. Additionally, frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have incorporated PWA support into their ecosystems, streamlining the development process.

Advantages of making all web apps PWA-ready include:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: PWAs offer a more seamless and engaging user experience compared to traditional web apps, leading to higher user satisfaction and retention.

2. **Increased Reach**: By being accessible via URLs and searchable on the web, PWAs can reach a wider audience compared to native apps, which often require installation from an app store.

3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Developing a single PWA that works across different platforms (desktop, mobile, tablet) can be more cost-effective than building separate native apps for each platform.

4. **Improved Performance**: PWAs are designed to be fast-loading and responsive, providing a better experience for users even on slower networks.

5. **Offline Functionality**: With service workers, PWAs can work offline or with limited connectivity, ensuring users can still access content and functionality even when they're not connected to the internet.

6. **No Installation Required**: Users can add PWAs to their home screens with a single tap, eliminating the need to download and install apps from an app store.
