> Consider this. A Business with both an app and a retail store. Along comes a potential Customer. Compare the experience on an app and in a retail store

This makes an Agile story...

> As an Businessman I want to connect personally to new Customers in real time so that I can improve my app's sales conversion rate. I need [pr0](https://goldlabel.pro)

### Part 1) Log into [pr0](https://goldlabel.pro?demo)

Log into the Demo account with these credentials

```
demo@goldlabel.pro
gl0149^_
```

### Part 2) Create a fingerprint

An anonymous customer lands on a Goldlabel App. As an owner I want to see this event in real time and be able to effect changes to the user's experience and ONLY that user's experience in real time

If I could ask you to simulate this by going to the app on your phone. In whatever browser you normally use, go to https://free.goldlabel.pro

What we should see in pr0 is that your fingerprint was created. I also got an email notification. 

Clicking on this new fingerprint brings up the full record

This is a fingerprint. It's an object representing a user. It uses a special algorithm to turn device info into a unique string which can be used to identify the device the next time because is won't change

As well as this fingerprint, the object also contains the user's ip address, location, browser, Operating System and that kind of thing. All useful information

How does this work with GDPR? we may well have found a way around the silliness
