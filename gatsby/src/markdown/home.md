Our technology is Open Source. It’s not secret, it’s not proprietary, you don’t have to pay for it. Which is how it should be. Should you do us the honour of trying it out and deciding that it’s an approach which suits you, then there are pathways for you to do that without suddenly being charged an arm and a leg. Mostly we offer consultancy services. We can support individual developers or whole teams to implement the Goldlabel platform in a controlled amount of time & cost
