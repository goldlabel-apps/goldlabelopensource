After many years of diving in Malta, Mark Bezzina decided to open Bezz MMarko Bezzinaalta Diving Centre in 2012. 

So, what does Bezz Diving meanâ€¦? Bezzina is a common surname in Malta and Marko is known as Bezz by most of his friends. When he started working in the diving industry and giving courses to his friends, Bezz Diving originated. This made the choice of the name of the dive centre pretty easy, chosen more by the friends rather by the owner! Bezz Diving is an owner-operated dive centre, you will definetly meet Bezz during your visit to the dive centre and he follows every course and client to make sure things are running smoothly for you. Born and brought up in Malta, he knows the island very well and he is willing to share his knowledge with everyone. He can recommend you the best beaches to visit ( as he likes to chill out during his free time too), restaurants where to eat, places where to dance or to listen to some good music, cities and authentic Maltese villages to visit. He provides every client with a free map of the Maltese islands, highlighting the most interesting places. So be ready, Bezz Diving is a Maltese experience!
