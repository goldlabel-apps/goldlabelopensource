'Stunning' and 'Spectacular' are just two words that spring to mind when describing the underwater topography around Gozo's coastline. Dive sites range from sheltered bays for dive training, to drop offs, wrecks, caverns and tunnels. With a mixture of crystal clear, warm waters, diving in Gozo is a must!!

With safety first and fun a very close second we actively encourage and promote safe, responsible diving through education and our instructors demonstrating good diving practices.

We have a wealth of experience in organising many family diving holidays, Dive Club trips, School Trips and Military Adventure Training holidays, so let us create an exceptional diving holiday just for you. We are open all year round so whether you want a summer diving holiday or you are looking to take advantage of our milder winters .......
