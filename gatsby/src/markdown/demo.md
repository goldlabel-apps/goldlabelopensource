### Start with pr0

Consider these 2 roles; Businessman & Customer  

> As an Businessman I want to connect personally to new Customers in real time so that I can improve my app's sales conversion rate. I need [pr0](https://goldlabel.pro)

[Here on pr0](https://goldlabel.pro?demo) you can log into a Demo account using these credentials

```
demo@goldlabel.pro
gl0149^_
```

### Infrastructure as Code

All Infrastructure such as Authentication, Database etc is handled by Google and is as secure as Google is

So in this case I have set you up with an account using your ceros email and the password... you'll like this... rhinoceros

Part 2

An anonymous customer lands on a Goldlabel App. As an owner I want to see this event in real time and be able to effect changes to the user's experience and ONLY that user's experience in real time

If I could ask you to simulate this by going to the app on your phone. In whatever browser you normally use, go to https://free.goldlabel.pro

What we should see in pr0 is that your fingerprint was created. I also got an email notification. 

Clicking on this new fingerprint brings up the full record

This is a fingerprint. It's an object representing a user. It uses a special algorithm to turn device info into a unique string which can be used to identify the device the next time because is won't change

As well as this fingerprint, the object also contains the user's ip address, location, browser, Operating System and that kind of thing. All useful information

How does this work with GDPR? we may well have found a way around the silliness
