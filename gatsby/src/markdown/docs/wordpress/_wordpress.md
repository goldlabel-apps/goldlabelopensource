Choosing WordPress for a company website is easy. It makes perfect sense. It has  versatility, ease of use, robust features, and strong community backing it. Other true reasons are User-Friendly Interface, Abundant Themes and Plugins, Scalability and Flexibility, SEO-Friendly, Community Support and Updates

Additionally, WordPress offers cost-effectiveness, as it is an open-source platform with no licensing fees. It also integrates well with various third-party tools and services, enhancing its functionality and usability for businesses. Ultimately, the combination of ease of use, customization options, SEO capabilities, scalability, and strong community support makes WordPress a top choice for building and managing a company website.

WordPress is great. But it has a time and a place. The time is in the past and the place is in the bin.
