## Goldlabel. Open Source and Forever Free

Built on the shoulders of giants

#### Get started

Identify where you're going to clone the repository. We'll call this `<working-repo>`. Decide on the machine readable name `<your-project>`. Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
cd <working-dir>
git clone https://github.com/listingslab-software/open-source <your-project>
cd <your-project>
cd gatsby
npm install
cd ../
npm start
```

When Gatsby has finished starting the dev server, it's available on 
http://localhost:8000

Open and configure `gatsby/src/goldlabelConfig`
